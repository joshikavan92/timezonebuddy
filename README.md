# TimezoneBuddy

Initial Release v1.0.0 - April 7, 2024

A macOS menu bar application that helps you track your teammates' time zones and initiate quick Slack & Email from anywhere in your screen. Perfect for distributed teams working across different time zones.
We interact a lot of our colleagues who works out of different timezones, and it always annoy to look at their slack or macOS Widget to check their city's name.
